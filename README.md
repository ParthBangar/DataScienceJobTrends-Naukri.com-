This analysis is one in my bucket list while i was learning Data Analytics. I wanted to know the availabilty of data science and data anayst jobs that will be available for me to grasp. But unfortunaly i wasn't able to scrape the data myself. This dataset is exactly what i was searching for. I found the insights very helpful and understood that i should soon start to learn python for data analysis :/ May be in the future i will try to come up with my own scraped data and similar or better visuals.
